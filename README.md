**Linear Regression in Rust with Burn Library**

**Overview**

This project implements a simple linear regression model using Rust and the Burn library (version 0.16.0). The goal is to predict the function y = 2x + 1 using synthetic training data with added noise. The model is trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and evaluated on unseen data.

**Requirements**
Ensure you have the following installed before starting the project:

Rust – Install from Rust Lang
Rust Rover IDE – Download from JetBrains
Git – Install from Git SCM

**Setup Instructions**
1. Install Rust and Verify Installation
rustup update
rustc --version
Ensure Rust is properly installed before proceeding.

2. Install Rust Rover IDE and Configure Git
Download Rust Rover from JetBrains and install it.
Install Git and set up version control integration in Rust Rover.

4. Clone the GitHub Repository
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd linear_regression_model
Replace <your-repository-url> with your actual GitHub repository link.

5. Initialize Cargo and Update Cargo.toml
Ensure the Cargo.toml file contains only the specified dependencies:
[dependencies]
burn = { version = "0.16.0", features = ["wgpu", "train"] }
burn-ndarray = "0.16.0"
rand = "0.9.0"
rgb = "0.8.50"
textplots = "0.8.6"

5. Run the Project
cargo run
This command compiles and runs the Rust project.

**Code Structure**
main.rs – Contains the implementation of the linear regression model.
Cargo.toml – Manages project dependencies.

**Implementation Details** 
Data Generation: Creates a synthetic dataset with random noise.
Model Definition: Implements a linear regression model using the Burn library.
Training Process: Uses stochastic gradient descent (SGD) to minimize the loss.
Evaluation: Tests the model on unseen data and visualizes the results.
Results and Reflection
The model successfully learns to approximate y = 2x + 1.

**Challenges faced:**
- Understanding how Burn handles tensor operations.
- Adjusting hyperparameters such as learning rate and batch size.
- Configuring dependencies correctly.
- Using Rust Rover IDE.
- 
**Future improvements:**
  - Extend to multiple variables (multi-variable regression).
- Implement deep learning approaches.
